# Natural Language Processing Guide

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language.

## Core NLP Tasks

### Text Classification

Text classification involves categorizing text into predefined groups. Applications include sentiment analysis, topic classification, and spam detection.

### Named Entity Recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies and classifies named entities in text into categories such as person names, organizations, locations, and dates.

### Machine Translation

Machine translation automatically translates text from one language to another. Modern systems use neural machine translation with encoder-decoder architectures.

## Modern Approaches

### Word Embeddings

Word embeddings represent words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. Popular methods include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.

### Transformer Models

Transformers have revolutionized NLP with their attention mechanism. Key models include:
- BERT for bidirectional context understanding
- GPT for text generation
- T5 for text-to-text tasks

### Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive text corpora and can perform a wide range of NLP tasks with few-shot or zero-shot learning.
