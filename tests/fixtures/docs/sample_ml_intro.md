# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The model makes predictions based on input-output pairs provided during training.

Common applications include:
- Classification (spam detection, image recognition)
- Regression (price prediction, weather forecasting)

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find patterns and relationships in the data without guidance.

Common applications include:
- Clustering (customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality reduction (feature extraction)

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an agent that learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve maximum cumulative reward.

Common applications include:
- Game playing (chess, Go)
- Robotics (autonomous navigation)

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers. These networks can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data.

Key architectures include:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data
- Transformers for natural language processing
